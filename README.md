lolshark

Features:

  Variety of options to search database for game data
  Ability to expand database if user is not in original seed
  User friendly and intuitive prompts

Overview:

  lolshark allows users to retrieve League of Legends statistics using Riot's APIs. Users can search via Summoner name, Champion name, or general stats. Option examples include overall win rate, win rate by champion selected, and champion pick/ban rate. 

  If a summoner does not already exist within lolshark's database, functionality allows lolshark to confirm the users' existance, pull information from Riot's APIs, and add the data to database. 

  By utilizing tty prompt, lolshark users can select through various menus and input specific summoner names to retrieve desired information. Entering a summoner name allows users to lookup and view statistics specific to their League of Legends account. Entering a champion name prompts a different menu with game data for the desired champion.

  Currently this application is updated through champion #145 - Qiyana introduce in patch 9.13. 

Input Notes

  At this time, lolshark does not accept summoner names with unusual characters. If a champion name is not showing correct data,the name may have been entered incorrectly. For example, "Kai'Sa" is acceptable as it matches Riot's characterization, but all lowercase "kai'sa" is not.
